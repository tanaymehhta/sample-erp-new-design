# Problems to Solve

## Current Issues in Polymer Application

### 1. Inventory Purchase - Register Deal Button Not Working
**Priority: High**
- **Issue**: When selecting items from inventory for purchase purposes, nothing happens when the "Register Deal" button is pressed
- **Location**: InventorySelector component and related deal registration flow
- **Console Errors**: React state update warnings in InventorySelector.tsx and NewDealForm.tsx
- **Impact**: Users cannot complete inventory-based purchases

### 2. Missing Mini Purchase Option for Insufficient Inventory
**Priority: High**
- **Issue**: When selling quantity exceeds available inventory, the system should automatically provide a mini purchase option to buy the remaining material
- **Current Behavior**: Shows "Need 14000kg more" but no purchase interface
- **Required Solution**: Mini purchase dialog with 4 main entries for purchasing additional material
- **Location**: Material Source selection flow
- **Impact**: Users cannot complete deals when inventory is insufficient

### 3. Deals History Not Updating (CURRENT FOCUS)
**Priority: Critical**
- **Issue**: When registering a normal deal (purchase qty = sale qty), it is not being appended to the deals history tab
- **Date Issue**: Deals history shows data for August 31st when today is August 26th - incorrect date filtering
- **Database Issue**: New deals are not being saved to the database or Google Sheets
- **Expected Behavior**: 
  - New deals should appear in deals history immediately after registration
  - Only show deals up to current date (August 26th)
  - Deals should be saved to both database and Google Sheets
- **Impact**: Business cannot track completed deals properly

### 4. Analytics Not Working
**Priority: Medium**
- **Issue**: Analytics tab is completely non-functional and appears disconnected from any data source
- **Current State**: No data display, no connections to database
- **Impact**: No business insights or reporting capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Follow the modular architecture guidelines in CLAUDE.md
- Ensure all fixes maintain loose coupling between features
- Add proper error handling and logging for each issue
- Write unit tests for any new functionality
- Update documentation for any modified APIs

## Next Steps
1. Start with Issue #3 (Deals History) as it's critical for business operations
2. Then address Issue #1 (Register Deal button)
3. Implement Issue #2 (Mini purchase option)
4. Finally tackle Issue #4 (Analytics)
